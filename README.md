# song_popularity_prediction

Spotify Dataset from Kaggle, which features close to 170,000 songs collected
from Spotify Web API is used. It contains a variety of numerical features such as popularity,
acousticness, danceability, duration, speechiness, and year as well as information about
artists and song names.
The project is focused mainly on song popularity prediction. Other similar projects focus on
guessing whether songs will be hits or not. (Elena Georgieva, 2020) (Fadelli, 2019).
The aim is to predict song popularity using the audio features. For this purpose, a neural network and the random forest regressor methods were implemented.
